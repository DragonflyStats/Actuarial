ITSwR Section 3 Forecasting Strategies
 acf computes (and by default plots) estimates of the autocovariance or autocorrelation function.
 pacf is the function used for the partial autocorrelations.
 ccf computes the cross-correlation or cross-covariance of two univariate series.

3.3 Bass Model
Quantifies the theory of adoption and diffusion of a new product by society. The model has been influential in marketing
Coefficient of Innovation
Coefficient of Imitation
 
Bass Formula
f(t) density
F(t) cumulation distribution
h(t) hazard function
h(t) =f(t)1-F(t)

tpeak=log(q) -log(p)p+q
 
3.4.1 Exponential Smoothing
a_t = \alphax_t + (1-\alpha)a_{t-1}  0 < \alpha < 1
Smoothing Parameter \alpha determines the amount of smoothing

3. 4.2 Holt Winters Method
This method uses exponentially weighted moving averages to update estimates of the seasonally adjusted mean (called the level), slope and seasonals.

Estiamted level a_t = \alpha(x_t -s_{t-p})+(1-\alpha)(a_{t-1} -s_{t-1})
Estimated slope b_t = \beta(a_t -a_{t-1})+(1-\beta)b_{t-1}
Estimated Swasonl effect
s_t = \gamma(x_t - a_{t})+(1-\gamma)s_{t-p}
Exercises 3.6
Describe the association and calculate the ccf between x and y  for k equal to 1, 10 and 100 respctively
w<-1:100
k<-c(1,10,100)
for (1 in 1:3)
k=1
{
x<-w+k*rnorm(100)
y<-w+k*rnorm(100)
ccf(x,y)
}
k=10
{
x<-w+k*rnorm(100)
y<-w+k*rnorm(100)
ccf(x,y)
}
k=100
{
x<-w+k*rnorm(100)
y<-w+k*rnorm(100)
ccf(x,y)
}
