Risk management

The VaR package estimates Value-at-Risk, and several packages provide functionality for Extreme Value Theory models: evd, evdbayes, evir, extRremes, ismev, POT.
The CreditMetrics package provides functions for Credit Risk modeling.
The QRMlib covers quantitative risk modelling.
The mvtnorm package provides code for multivariate Normal and t-distributions.
The Rmetrics packages fPortfolio and fExtremes also contain a number of relevant functions.
The copula and fgac packages cover multivariate dependency structures using copula methods.
The actuar package provides an actuarial perspective to risk management.
The ghyp package provides generalized hyberbolic distribution functions as well as procedures for VaR, CVaR or target-return portfolio optimizations.
The ChainLadder package provides functions for modeling insurance claim reserves.

Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) = Core Body of Knowledge
format:  4 twenty minute presentations on R packages
Target Audience: Non R Users

Applications of R in Finance
Contributed packages for R span every application in finance, including:
Financial Data: Time series (regular and irregular); financial calendars; database query; access to financial data sources Yahoo, Bloomberg, FAME, Interactive Brokers and more.
Financial instruments: options, bonds, yield curves, portfolios, technical trading rules.
Time Series: Classical time series analysis (ARIMA, Kalman filters); volatility modeling (incl. GARCH); unit root and cointegration tests; dynamic models; wavelet analysis; and more.
Risk management: Value at Risk, cVaR, Credit Risk, quantitative risk modeling, portfolio optimization.
Econometrics: generalized linear regression, quantile regression, generalized additive models, microeconomic models.
Financial analytics: Simulation, backtesting, regression, copulas, random matrix theory, stochastic differential equations, factor analysis, actuarial methods, constrained optimization.
