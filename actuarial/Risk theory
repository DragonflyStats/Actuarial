Risk theory refers to a body of techniques to model and measure the risk associated with a
portfolio of insurance contracts. A rst approach consists in modeling the distribution of total
claims over a xed period of time using the classical collective model of risk theory. A second
input of interest to the actuary is the evolution of the surplus of the insurance company over
many periods of time. 

In ruin theory, the main quantity of interest is the probability that the
surplus becomes negative, in which case technical ruin of the insurance company occurs.
The interested reader can nd more on these subjects in Klugman et al. (2004); Gerber (1979);
Denuit and Charpentier (2004); Kaas, Goovaerts, Dhaene, and Denuit (2001), among others.
The current version of actuar contains four visible functions related to the above problems:
two for the calculation of the aggregate claim amount distribution and two for ruin probability
calculations.

We briefly expose the underlying models before we introduce each set of functions.
