R packages for Actuarial Analysis
===========================================

1. **actuar**	Actuarial functions including functions related to loss distributions, risk theory (including ruin theory), compound hierarchical model simulation, and credibility theory. The package includes probability functions commonly used in insurance (especially heavy tailed distributions).
2. **ActuDistns**	Functions for actuarial scientists that compute the probability density function, hazard rate function, integrated hazard rate function, and the quantile function for 44 commonly used survival models.
3. **CompLognormal**	Functions for actuarial scientists. The functions compute the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function, and random numbers of any composite model based on the lognormal distribution.
4. **lifecontingencies**	An R package to perform actuarial mathematics for life contingencies insurances.
5. **ChainLadder**	The ChainLadder package in R provides various statistical methods which are typically used for the estimation of outstanding claims reserves in general insurance. The package has implementations of the Mack, Munich, bootstrap, multivariate, and chain-ladder factor models (CLFM); and also the loss development factor curve fitting methods of Dave Clark and generalised linear model based reserving models.
6. **ELT**	An R package to help actuaries build experience life tables. It contains functions to calculate exposure and the number of deaths, smoothing with four different methods, and validation with three criteria.
7. **DCL** Claims reserving (in non-life insurance) under the double chain ladder model.
8. **MRMR**	Multivariate Regression Models for Reserving (tools to analyse non-life loss reserves).
9. **lossDev**	Loss development for insurance triangles, using MCMC.
